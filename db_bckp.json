If you want to have text rendered in 3D, well, that's another story. As you pointed out correctly, you can only use sprites, tiled backgrounds and 9-patches a source textures for 3d shapes.",

The text needs to be on the boxes to show the scores so the player sees the text on the box. When the player looks away from the box, the player will no longer see the text.",
